#Project for fun and learning purposes

For now - please don't mind me.
I'm just playing with different solutions and checking things out here.
As for the project it's about 60-70% done.

Tech stack: React-Redux
mobile-first approach
Bundler: Webpack

Todo next:
1. Build scoring mechanism
2. Build score screen/grading
3. Add responsivity
4. Add some kind of a preloader for images
5. Add credit where it's due

Todo a little later
6. Refactor navigation and ingredient selection (into one function)
7. Consider adding propTypes
8. Consider adding translations
