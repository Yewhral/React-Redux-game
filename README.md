#Project for fun and learning purposes

For now - please don't mind me.
I'm just playing with different solutions and checking things out here.
As for the project it's about 80% done.

Tech stack: React-Redux
mobile-first approach
Bundler: Webpack
Unit tests: Jest

Todo next:
1. Add responsivity, and fix CSS naming convention while at it
2. Add statistics that will be easier to read
3. Add some kind of a preloader for images

Todo a little later
1. Refactor navigation and ingredient selection
2. Consider adding propTypes
3. Consider adding translations
